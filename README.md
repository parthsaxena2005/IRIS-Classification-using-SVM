# Iris Flower Classification using Support Vector Machine

## Introduction
The Iris flowers are genus of flowering plants. there exist three primary species Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica each of which exhibits varying features and characteristics such as length and width of sepals and petals etc.

Our aim is to develop a machine learning model to accurately classify a iris flower based upon the given data.

## Model
This project focuses on the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for prediction.

## DATA
The data is stored in ''Iris Classification Data.csv'' and is also available as a preincluded dataset within the sklearn library.
The dataset includes several columns, 70% of Data was randomly selected and used to train the model and the remainig 30% to test it.

```bash
Columns Included:-
  1.  sepal length (cm)	    
  2.  sepal width (cm)
  3.  petal length (cm)
  4.  petal width (cm)

Class:
    - Iris-Setosa
    - Iris-Versicolour
    - Iris-Virginica
```



## Conclusion
The model was able to attain accuracy score of 00.9904761904761905 (nearly a 99.04% accurate model) using the model.
